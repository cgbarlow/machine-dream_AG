📚 Learned Strategies (4):

   1. ""Last Digit in Row""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a row has only one empty cell remaining and you need to place a specific digit that's missing from that row, while checking that the digit isn't already present in the corresponding column or 3x3 box.
      Reasoning:
         Identify a row with exactly one empty cell
         Determine which digits are missing from that row
         Check if the missing digit is already present in the same column or 3x3 box
         If the digit isn't blocked by column or box constraints, place it

   2. ""Single Valid Candidate""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a cell has multiple constraints (row, column, box) that eliminate all but one possible digit, leaving only one valid candidate for that cell.
      Reasoning:
         Examine the row, column, and 3x3 box that contain the target cell
         Identify which digits are already present in each constraint area
         Eliminate those digits from the set of possible values (1-9)
         If only one digit remains as a possibility, that is your solution

   3. ""Last Digit in Row/Column/Box""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a row, column, or box has only one empty cell remaining, and all other digits 1-9 have been placed in that unit.
      Reasoning:
         Identify a row, column, or box with exactly one empty cell
         Check which digits from 1-9 are already present in that same row/column/box
         The missing digit must go in the only remaining empty cell

   4. ""Last Digit in Row/Column/Box""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a row, column, or box has exactly one empty cell remaining, and all other digits 1-9 are already present in that unit (row/column/box).
      Reasoning:
         Identify a row, column, or box with only one empty cell
         Check which digits from 1-9 are already present in that same row/column/box
         The missing digit must fill the remaining empty cell


🧠 Abstraction Hierarchy:

   Level 0: Specific Instances
      - Placing 7 in the last empty cell of row 4 when digits 1-6,8,9 are already present in that row, column 3, and box 5
      - Filling the final cell in box 2 with digit 5 after all other digits 1-4,6-9 appear in corresponding row/column constraints
      - Determining 3 is the only valid candidate for cell (5,7) when rows, columns, and boxes eliminate all other digits
   Level 1: Named Techniques
      - Last Digit Placement
      - Single Candidate Elimination
      - Unit Completion Analysis
      - Constraint-Based Deduction
   Level 2: Strategy Categories
      - Completion Strategies
      - Elimination Techniques
      - Logical Deduction Methods
   Level 3: General Principles
      - Fill remaining spaces when all alternatives are eliminated
      - Derive solutions through systematic constraint elimination
