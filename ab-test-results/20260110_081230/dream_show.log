📚 Learned Strategies (3):

   1. ""Last Digit in Constraint""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a row, column, or box has only one empty cell that can legally contain a specific digit.
      Reasoning:
         Identify a constraint (row, column, or box) that is nearly complete with several digits filled.
         Check which digits from 1-9 are missing in that constraint.
         For each missing digit, determine if it has only one possible location within the constraint where it won't violate Sudoku rules.
         If exactly one empty cell remains as the valid placement for a specific digit, place that digit there.

   2. ""Last Digit Elimination""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a cell has many constraints (highly restricted) and only one digit remains possible after eliminating all other candidates based on row, column, and box constraints.
      Reasoning:
         Identify a cell that is constrained by its row, column, and box - look for cells with 7+ of the 9 digits already placed in their respective regions
         List all known values in the cell's row, column, and box to identify which digits are blocked from placement
         Eliminate each blocked digit from the set of possible candidates (1-9)
         If only one candidate remains, that must be the solution

   3. ""Intersection Consistency Check""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a cell's value can be determined by analyzing the intersection of row, column, and box constraints simultaneously, particularly when one or more of these constraint sets contain limited options.
      Reasoning:
         Identify all possible values for the target cell based on its row constraints
         Identify all possible values for the target cell based on its column constraints
         Identify all possible values for the target cell based on its box constraints
         Find the unique value that satisfies ALL three constraint sets simultaneously
         Verify this value doesn't violate any of the individual constraint rules


🧠 Abstraction Hierarchy:

   Level 0: Specific Instances
      - Last Digit in Constraint: Single empty cell with one possible digit
      - Last Digit Elimination: Highly restricted cell with only one remaining candidate
      - Intersection Consistency Check: Cell value determined by simultaneous row/column/box analysis
   Level 1: Named Techniques
      - Last Digit Strategies: All variants focusing on single remaining possibilities
      - Intersection Analysis: Methods using overlapping constraint intersections
      - Elimination Techniques: Approaches narrowing candidates through constraint analysis
   Level 2: Strategy Categories
      - Completion Strategies: Filling in final digits when options are limited
      - Constraint Intersections: Using multiple constraint overlaps to solve cells
      - Candidate Reduction: Narrowing possibilities through systematic elimination
   Level 3: General Principles
      - Single Possibility Principle: When only one option remains, it must be correct
      - Intersection Consistency Principle: Overlapping constraints provide definitive solutions
