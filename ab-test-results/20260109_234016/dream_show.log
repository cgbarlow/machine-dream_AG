📚 Learned Strategies (2):

   1. ""Last Digit in Row""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a row has only one empty cell and you can identify which digit from the set {1-9} is missing from that row, column, and box constraints.
      Reasoning:
         Examine all cells in a specific row to count how many digits are already present
         Identify which of the numbers 1 through 9 are still needed in that row
         For the single empty cell in that row, check if any of those missing numbers would violate column or box constraints when placed there
         If only one number can possibly fit without violating Sudoku rules, place it in that cell

   2. ""Last Digit in Unit""
      Level: 1 (Technique)
      When: When a cell is the only remaining position in a row, column, or box where a specific digit can legally go, or when all other positions in that unit have been eliminated for a particular number.
      Reasoning:
         Identify which row, column, or box contains the target cell
         Check what digits are already present in that same row/column/box
         Eliminate those numbers from the possible candidates for the target cell
         If only one digit remains as valid, place it in the cell


🧠 Abstraction Hierarchy:

   Level 0: Specific Instances
      - Filling the last empty cell in row 5 with digit 7 because columns 1,2,3 and box 4,5,6 already contain {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9}
      - Placing digit 9 in the only remaining position in column 8 where it can legally go
      - Identifying that cell (3,7) is the last place in box 3 where digit 5 can be placed
   Level 1: Named Techniques
      - Last Digit in Row
      - Last Digit in Unit
      - Single Position Placement
   Level 2: Strategy Categories
      - Completion Strategies
      - Elimination Techniques
   Level 3: General Principles
      - Fill available spaces when constraints eliminate all other possibilities
      - Identify unique placement opportunities within constrained units
