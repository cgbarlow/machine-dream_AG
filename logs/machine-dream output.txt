   ROW: 1
COL: 3
VALUE: 2
REASONING: Looking at row 1, I need to find where the digit 2 can go. The digits already present in row 1 are 5 and 3. Checking column 3, I see that 8 is already placed in position (3,3), so 2 cannot go there.

Looking more carefully at row 1: positions (1,1)=5, (1,2)=3, (1,3)=., (1,4)=., (1,5)=7, (1,6)=., (1,7)=., (1,8)=., (1,9)=.
Checking the constraints:
- Row 1 already has: 5, 3, 7
- Column 3 has: 8 in (3,3), so we need to check if any other cells in column 3 have 2
- Box 1 (top-left) contains: 5, 3, 6, 9, 8 - no 2 yet

Checking each empty cell in row 1 for possible value 2:
- Position (1,3): Column 3 has 8 in (3,3), but we need to check if other cells in column 3 have 2. Let me recheck: column 3 contains [8, ., 6] from rows 3, 7, and 9 respectively.
- Position (1,4): Need to check constraints
- Position (1,6): Need to check constraints
- Position (1,7): Need to check constraints
- Position (1,8): Need to check constraints
- Position (1,9): Need to check constraints

Actually, let me reconsider the possible positions systematically. In row 1, with known digits 5 and 3 and 7, we need a 2 in one of the remaining cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), or (1,9).

Looking at box 1 (top-left): it contains positions (1,1)=5, (1,2)=3, (2,1)=6, (2,2)=., (2,3)=., (3,1)=., (3,2)=9, (3,3)=8. The missing digits in this box are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, but we already have 5 and 3 in the row, so checking what's allowed.

Actually, let me be more methodical: In row 1, I can only place a 2 in positions (1,3), (1,4), or (1,6) since that's where there are no conflicts with existing numbers. Let me check box 1 specifically for other constraints:

Box 1 contains the following cells:
- Row 1: (1,1)=5, (1,2)=3, (1,3)=?
- Row 2: (2,1)=6, (2,2)=?, (2,3)=?
- Row 3: (3,1)=?, (3,2)=9, (3,3)=8

Since row 1 already has 5 and 3, I need to make sure that placing a 2 in (1,3) doesn't conflict with column 3 or box 1.
Column 3 currently has: [8] from (3,3), so there's no 2 yet.
Box 1 contains elements 5,3,6,9,8 - so we can place a 2.

Therefore placing 2 in cell (1,3) should be valid. Let me double check:

ROW: 1
COL: 3
VALUE: 2

Checking:
- Row 1 constraint: Has 5, 3, 7 already. Adding 2 is fine.
- Column 3 constraint: Currently has 8 in (3,3), so no conflict with 2.
- Box 1 constraint: Contains 5,3,6,9,8 - doesn't contain 2, so safe.

This looks correct and valid.

   ROW: 1
COL: 3
VALUE: 4
REASONING: Looking at row 1, I need to find where digit 4 can go. The digits already present in row 1 are 5 and 3. Available digits for row 1 are 1,2,4,6,7,8,9.
Looking at the 3x3 box that contains cell (1,3), I need to check what numbers are already used there:
Box (1,1) through (3,3): 5,3,6,9,8,9,6 - so digits 1,2,4,7 are still available.
Checking column 3: 8,9,6,3,1,6,2,5 - the digit 4 is not yet in column 3.
Looking at other cells in row 1 and box (1,1) to eliminate possibilities:
- Cell (1,3): Need to determine what fits
- Looking more carefully at the constraints for cell (1,3):
  Row 1: has 5,3 - need 1,2,4,6,7,8,9
  Column 3: has 8,9,6,3,1,6,2,5 - doesn't have 4
  Box (1,1): has 5,3,6,9,8 - needs 1,2,4,7

Since the only remaining possibility for cell (1,3) that satisfies all constraints is 4.

Wait, let me reconsider this more systematically. I need to avoid repeating my previous incorrect move of (1,3)=2.

Looking at row 1 again: [5,3,.,.,7,.,.,.,.]
The possible values for the empty cells in row 1 are determined by what's missing from that row.
Row 1 has 5 and 3. Missing numbers from 1-9: 1,2,4,6,7,8,9

Looking at column 3: [.,.,8,.,.,.,2,.,.]
The possible values for (1,3) are determined by what's missing in column 3:
Column 3 has 8,9,6,3,1,6,2,5. Missing from 1-9: 4,7

Looking at the top-left box (1,1)-(3,3): [5,3,.,6,.,.,.,9,8]
Missing numbers in this box from 1-9: 1,2,4,7

Intersection of column 3's constraints and box constraints for cell (1,3):
Column 3 missing: 4,7
Box constraint: 1,2,4,7
Common values: 4,7

So either 4 or 7 could go in position (1,3).
I previously tried value 2 which was wrong, so I should try a different value.
Let's try the value that appears to be most constrained - 4.

ROW: 1
COL: 3
VALUE: 4
REASONING: After analyzing all constraints for cell (1,3):
- Row 1 needs digits 1,2,4,6,7,8,9 (already has 5,3)
- Column 3 needs digits 1,2,4,7 (already has 8,9,6,3,1,6,2,5)
- Box (1,1)-(3,3) needs digits 1,2,4,7 (already has 5,3,6,9,8)

The intersection of all constraints shows that only 4 or 7 can go in cell (1,3).
Since I previously tried and failed with value 2 in this position, and based on the logical deduction above, I'll try 4 as it's a valid candidate.

   ROW: 1
COL: 4
VALUE: 2
REASONING: Looking at row 1, I need to find where the digit 2 can go. The digits already present in row 1 are 5, 3, 4 (from positions 1,2,3). So far row 1 has: 5 3 4 . 7 . . . .
Looking at column 4, I need to check what numbers are already there. Column 4 contains: . 1 . . 8 . . 4 .
Looking at the top-left 3x3 box (positions 1,1 through 3,3), I see that 5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8 are already present.
In row 1, positions 4, 5, 6 contain . 7 . so far.
Position (1,4) is the only available empty spot in row 1 that could potentially be a 2.

Let me verify this is valid:
- Row 1: 5 3 4 2 7 . . . . - no duplicates
- Column 4: . 1 . . 8 . . 4 . - no conflict with 2 in position (1,4)
- Box 1 (top-left): 5 3 4 6 9 8 . . . - no duplicate of 2

Checking more carefully:
Looking at the middle row (row 5) which has 4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
This shows that in column 4, we have values: 7 in position (1,4), but I'm checking if I can place a 2 there.
Let me reconsider - I already determined that the 2 could go in row 1, column 4.

Actually, let me recheck what's in row 1 again:
Row 1: 5 3 4 . 7 . . . .
So positions (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) are empty.
Column 4 has: . 1 . . 8 . . 4 .
Box 1 (top-left): 5 3 4 6 9 8
The only remaining digit for row 1 that's not yet placed is 2 in column 4.

So placing a 2 at position (1,4) should be valid. This would make row 1: 5 3 4 2 7 . . . .

ROW: 1
COL: 4
VALUE: 2
REASONING: In row 1, the digits 5, 3, 4 are already present. The available positions in this row are columns 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Looking at column 4 specifically, it contains values from other rows but no 2 yet. In the top-left box (1-3,1-3), we have 5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8 already placed - so 2 is still available for this box area. Since row 1 has digits 5, 3, 4 and column 4 has no 2 yet, placing 2 at (1,4) satisfies Sudoku rules. This leaves positions (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) in row 1 to be filled with remaining numbers from 1-9 not already used in that row/column/box.

   ROW: 1
COL: 4
VALUE: 6
REASONING: Looking at row 1, I need to find what number can go in position (1,4). The numbers already present in row 1 are 5, 3, 4. So available digits are 1,2,6,7,8,9.

Looking at column 4, the numbers are: 6 (row 1), 1 (row 2), 8 (row 5), 4 (row 8). Available digits for this column are 2,3,5,7,9.

Looking at box 2 (top-middle 3x3 grid) which contains positions (1,4)-(1,6), (2,4)-(2,6), (3,4)-(3,6):
- Row 1: 5,3,4,. ,. ,.
- Row 2: 6,. ,. ,1,9,5
- Row 3: . ,9,8,. ,.,.

Looking at the known values in box 2: 5,3,4,1,9,5,6,8,9 - wait let me be more careful about what's in this box.
The positions in box 2 are:
(1,4), (1,5), (1,6)
(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)
(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)

Known values: 5,3,4 (row 1), 1,9,5 (row 2), 9,8 (row 3)
So we have 5,3,4,1,9,5,9,8 in the box. Available digits are 2,6,7

Checking if I can place a number:
- For column 4: need to check what's already in column 4
- Column 4 values: 6 (row 1), 1 (row 2), 8 (row 5), 4 (row 8)
So available for column 4 are 2,3,5,7,9

But we also need to consider that I've already tried:
- Move 3: (1,4)=2 → VALID_BUT_WRONG
This means placing a 2 in position (1,4) was legal but incorrect.

So if the only remaining candidate is 6 from our earlier analysis, and I haven't attempted it yet, let's try that.

Actually, rechecking row 1: we have 5,3,4 already placed.
For column 4: 6,1,8,4 are in place (rows 1,2,5,8)
So available numbers for position (1,4) are the remaining digits from {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} that aren't in row, column, or box.
- Not 5,3,4 (row 1)
- Not 6 (column 4)
- Available: 1,2,7,8,9

Looking at the remaining constraints:
Box 2 values so far: 5,3,4,1,9,5,9,8
That's actually 5,3,4,1,9,8 in that box (duplicates don't count).
Available in box for column 4 are: 2,6,7

Intersection of available digits from row constraint and column constraint and box constraint:
Row 1: {1,2,6,7,8,9}
Column 4: {1,2,7,8,9}
Box 2 (columns 4-6): {2,6,7}

Common values are: {2,6,7}

I haven't tried putting a 6 in position (1,4) yet. This would be the first valid candidate.

ROW: 1
COL: 4
VALUE: 6
REASONING: Based on constraint analysis - row 1 needs to contain digits 1-9 with 5,3,4 already filled; column 4 has 6,1,8,4 already placed; box 2 (top-middle) contains values that don't include 6. The only candidate left for cell (1,4) is 6 which satisfies all constraints and hasn't been attempted yet in this position.

   ROW: 1
COL: 5
VALUE: 8
REASONING: Looking at row 1, I need to find what number can go in position (1,5). The numbers already present in row 1 are 5, 3, 4, 6, 7. So the missing numbers are 1, 2, 8, 9.

Looking at column 5, the numbers present are: 7 (from row 1), 9 (from row 2), 6 (from row 4), 3 (from row 5), 2 (from row 7), 1 (from row 8), 8 (from row 9). Wait, let me double-check column 5:
Row 1: 7
Row 2: 9
Row 3: ?
Row 4: 6
Row 5: 3
Row 6: ?
Row 7: 2
Row 8: 1
Row 9: 8

So column 5 has: 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8. Missing are 4 and 5.

Looking at the top-middle 3x3 box (rows 1-3, cols 4-6), I need to check what's in that area:
Row 1: 6, 7, .
Row 2: 1, 9, 5
Row 3: ., ., .

So far in this box, I have 1, 5, 6, 7, 9. Missing are 2, 3, 4, 8.

Now checking position (1,5) specifically:
- Row constraint: Need to avoid 5,3,4,6,7 - so can be 1,2,8,9
- Column constraint: Need to avoid 7,9,6,3,2,1,8 - so only 4 or 5 left... Wait I made a mistake.

Let me recheck column 5 properly:
Column 5 has values from rows 1-9 at col 5:
Row 1: 7
Row 2: 9
Row 3: ?
Row 4: 6
Row 5: 3
Row 6: ?
Row 7: 2
Row 8: 1
Row 9: 8

So column 5 has: 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8. The missing numbers are 4 and 5.

Looking at the middle-right 3x3 box (rows 1-3, cols 7-9) for position (1,5):
Row 1: . . .
Row 2: . . .
Row 3: . 6 .

This doesn't help much. Let me reconsider row 1 more carefully.
In row 1 I have: 5, 3, 4, 6, 7 at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) - but wait, (1,3)=4 and (1,4)=6 so far. So row 1 is: 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, ?, ?, ?

So I need to place values in positions (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9).
Numbers available for row 1: 1, 2, 8, 9
Available numbers from column 5 constraint: 4, 5

This creates a contradiction. Let me recheck the initial puzzle state carefully.

Looking at the grid again:
Row 1: 5 3 4 6 7 . . .
Column 5 has values from rows 1-9 in col 5:
Row 1: 7
Row 2: 9
Row 3: ?
Row 4: 6
Row 5: 3
Row 6: ?
Row 7: 2
Row 8: 1
Row 9: 8

So column 5 contains: 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8. Available numbers for row 1 col 5 are: 4, 5.

Looking at the 3x3 box (rows 1-3, cols 4-6):
Row 1: 6, 7, ?
Row 2: 1, 9, 5
Row 3: ?, ?, ?

So this box has 1, 5, 6, 7, 9. Missing are 2, 3, 4, 8.

For (1,5), considering row 1: needs to avoid 5,3,4,6,7 → could be 1,2,8,9
But column 5 already has 7,9,6,3,2,1,8 → so it can't be any of those.
This is impossible - let me reread the actual current grid state.

Row 1: 5 3 4 6 7 . . .
Column 5 values (from row positions):
Row 1: 7
Row 2: 9
Row 3: ?
Row 4: 6
Row 5: 3
Row 6: ?
Row 7: 2
Row 8: 1
Row 9: 8

So column 5 has values {7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8}. The only missing numbers in that column are {4, 5}.

In row 1: we have fixed 5, 3, 4, 6, 7.
So the remaining positions (1,5) through (1,9) must contain 1, 2, 8, 9.
Since column 5 already has 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, this means that if we have a number in row 1 position (1,5), it can't be any of those values - which means none of them are valid.

Wait! I made an error. The current state has fixed numbers only at:
Row 1: 5 3 4 6 7 . . .
Row 2: 6 . . 1 9 5 . . .

The dots represent empty spaces.

So row 1 is actually: 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, ?, ?, ?
And the numbers that need to go in positions (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) are from {1,2,8,9}.

Position (1,5) is currently empty and needs a number from the set of missing values for row 1.
The only numbers that can't be in row 1 are those already present: 5,3,4,6,7.
So (1,5) should contain one of {1,2,8,9}.

But looking at column 5:
Row 1 has value 7
Row 2 has value 9
Row 3 has value ?
Row 4 has value 6
Row 5 has value 3
Row 6 has value ?
Row 7 has value 2
Row 8 has value 1
Row 9 has value 8

So column 5 already contains {2,3,6,7,8,9} so the remaining numbers to place in col 5 are {1,4,5}.

But (1,5) is in row 1 and column 5.
So for position (1,5):
- Row constraint: Can't be 5,3,4,6,7 → can be 1,2,8,9
- Column constraint: Can't be 2,3,6[2026-01-08T00:36:30.936Z] [ERROR]
